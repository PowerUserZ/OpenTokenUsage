Read AGENTS.md first — it has the general rules (simplicity, error handling, PR checklist).
This file holds the project facts that are easy to get wrong.

## What this is
- OpenTokenUsage: **Windows-only** Tauri v2 tray app (React 19 + Tailwind v4 frontend, Rust host).
  Derived from `robinebers/openusage` (left GitHub's fork network 2026-09-28); there is no macOS build — don't add macOS code paths back.
- Upstream (`upstream` remote) is now a Swift macOS app. **Never `git merge upstream/main`.**
  Port provider fixes by hand: read `git show upstream/main:CHANGELOG.md`, compare the Swift
  provider in `upstream/main:Sources/OpenUsage/Providers/<X>/` with `plugins/<x>/plugin.js`.
  The last Tauri upstream is branch `upstream/tauri-legacy` (= v0.6.28).

## Plugins (providers)
- `plugins/<id>/plugin.js` runs in **a fresh QuickJS runtime per probe**: module-level variables
  do NOT survive between refreshes (vitest reuses one instance, so tests hide this). Persist
  anything cross-probe under `ctx.app.pluginDataDir` (see claude `live-plan.json`).
- Every line label a plugin can emit on the overview card must be declared `scope: "overview"` in
  `plugin.json`, or that account type gets a blank card (the card filters by manifest labels).
- Response bodies are logged (first 500 chars) after `redact_body` in
  `src-tauri/src/plugin_engine/host_api.rs` — on any new endpoint, add identity fields
  (email, name, uuid, ids) to the redaction list with a test.
- Host already handles: HTTP 429 backoff per plugin+URL (`plugin_engine/http_gate.rs`), probe
  timeout (30 s), one probe per plugin at a time, panics → error result. Don't re-implement in JS.
- Paths: `~/Library/Application Support/<X>` is mapped to `%APPDATA%\<X>` by `expand_path`.
  SQLite goes through bundled `rusqlite` (no `sqlite3` CLI); no `ps`/`lsof`/`security` on Windows.
- Release builds run only the bundled plugins (copied to `%APPDATA%\com.sunstory.openusage\plugins`);
  the repo's `plugins/` is picked up from the cwd in **debug builds only** (`#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`
  in `plugin_engine/mod.rs`) — never make that path reachable in release. Plugin ids must match
  `[a-z0-9-]`; `entry` and `icon` must stay inside the plugin folder.
- Host HTTP caps response bodies at 8 MB and honors `dangerouslyIgnoreTls` for loopback URLs only.

## UI
- Windows 11 Fluent look: colors are tokens in `src/index.css` (`--accent-base` = Windows accent
  from the registry, `.backdrop` = Mica active → translucent layers). Use tokens, not hex colors.
- **i18n:** every UI string goes through `t("key")` (`src/lib/i18n.ts`); plugin line labels through
  `tLabel()`. `src/locales/en.ts` is the source; a new key must be added to **all 11 locale files**
  (TypeScript fails otherwise). Keep `{placeholders}` identical (checked by `locales.test.ts`).
  Never compare translated text in logic. The native tray menu gets its labels from the frontend
  (`set_tray_menu_labels`).
- **Translation rule (always):** whenever a feature adds or changes user-facing text, update the
  key in **all 11 languages in the same change**: `src/locales/*.ts` for UI, plus
  `src/locales/plugin-errors/*.ts` for plugin errors. Rewording the English means rewording every
  language, and never paste English into another locale. `translation-lock.test.ts` fails when
  English text changes; after translating everything, run `bun run locales:lock`. Never re-lock
  without translating first.
- Errors: `getPluginErrorAction` turns known errors into one-click fixes: a login command →
  `run_in_terminal` (Rust allow-list in `setup_actions.rs`, test-synced with the plugin fixtures),
  a missing API-key env var → the Windows Environment Variables dialog. Env vars are also read from
  the registry, so a key added while the app is running works on the next refresh.
- Tray metric: one setting, `trayMetric` (auto | Session | Weekly), drives bars, percent and tooltip.
  Tray provider `tightest` = "Most used" line across providers. `trayHiddenPlugins` keeps a provider
  in the nav but out of the tray. The tray icon color follows the *taskbar* theme, not the app theme:
  `window_style::watch_taskbar_theme` sends `taskbar:theme` the moment Windows switches it.
- Tray styles `numbers`/`logos` = one tray icon per provider (`use-provider-tray-icons.ts` draws,
  `tray::set_provider_tray_icons` shows them and hides the app icon). Update icons in place, never
  recreate (Windows keys "show next to clock" on tray-icon's creation-counter uID). A hidden tray
  icon rejects `setIcon`, so the app icon is redrawn after it's shown again. Our icons (the app icon
  too) are promoted via `HKCU\Control Panel\NotifyIconSettings\*\IsPromoted` only when the user hasn't
  chosen yet, matched by exe file name (Program Files paths are stored as `{GUID}\OpenTokenUsage\...`),
  retried for 30 s because Explorer writes the entry late. Explorer applies the value live.
- Taskbar strip (experimental, `taskbar_strip.rs`): a layered child window of `Shell_TrayWnd`
  left of `TrayNotifyWnd`, on its own thread (it shares Explorer's input queue: never block, never
  hold a lock across Win32 calls). Layered child windows need the Win8+ `<compatibility>` in
  `src-tauri/app.manifest` (wired in `build.rs`) — don't drop it. The frontend draws the image
  (`src/lib/taskbar-strip.ts`); its 1/255-alpha background keeps the whole strip clickable.
  Its look lives in `taskbarStripStyle` (fonts, colors, usage thresholds, and its own provider list
  and order, max 6, independent of the nav order; per provider both/session/weekly; color scales
  in `TASKBAR_STRIP_COLOR_SCALES`, "base" = the text color). The strip and the tray styles that show numbers
  exclude each other: enabling the strip sets the tray to "icon", picking another style turns it off.
  A strip click opens the panel above the strip (`tray::toggle_panel_at`, via `run_on_main_thread`).
- Panel: the title bar pin (`panelPinned`) keeps it always on top. "Remember position": `tray.rs`
  records every position it sets itself (`place`); any other move while visible is the user's drag
  and is saved as `panelPosition` (outer top-left, physical px) in settings.json, then used by
  `anchor_panel`/`toggle_panel_at`, clamped into the work area. Move the panel only through `place()`,
  or your move is remembered as a drag.
- Support: the side-nav coffee cup (`BmcCup`, from Buy Me a Coffee's brand kit: outline `currentColor`, coffee
  `--support` yellow) opens `SupportDialog`; the About window and the tray menu open `SUPPORT_URL` (TS ↔ tray.rs,
  test-synced). A dialog taller than a short panel sets `data-panel-dialog`: app-shell's `has-[…]:min-h` grows the
  panel while it's open (the window follows the content height).
- Ring logos are sized by `measureLogoExtent` (how far the logo's pixels reach) so square logos stay
  inside the ring and round ones grow.
- Themes: `dark` (default, pure black: classes `.dark.oled`) | `light`. `useSettingsTheme` also sets the
  window theme: Mica takes its tint from the window, so a light page on dark Windows needs it.
- Notifications (`src/lib/usage-alerts.ts`, pure + tested): the usage levels the user picks
  (`alertSettings.levels`, default 80/95), pace, reset; each once per provider+line+window, keys
  persisted in settings (`sentUsageAlerts`). Toasts are silent (an unpackaged app can't give a toast
  its own sound): `alert_sound.rs` plays the chosen sound with PlaySound (the `Notification.Default`
  alias, bundled `src-tauri/sounds/*.wav` from Kenney, CC0, ids test-synced with `ALERT_SOUNDS`, or
  the user's file, converted to 16-bit PCM WAV in `src/lib/alert-sound.ts`) and skips it during Do
  Not Disturb.
- Status badge: optional `statusPageUrl` in plugin.json (Atlassian Statuspage `/api/v2/status.json`
  only — verify the URL returns that JSON before adding one).
- Local HTTP API (127.0.0.1:6736) is loopback-only: no CORS, Host/Origin must be loopback. Don't add
  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` back (any website could read usage).
- Keyboard: Ctrl (not Cmd/Win) shortcuts; show Ctrl/Alt in the UI.

## Security
- CSP lives in `tauri.conf.json` (`script-src 'self'`; `img-src` data:/blob:; `connect-src` only IPC +
  `https://api.github.com`). The dev server runs WITHOUT it, so a new remote fetch/image/font source
  works in `tauri dev` and silently breaks in release: add it to the CSP and test a release build
  (`bun tauri build --no-bundle`, run `src-tauri/target/release/opentokenusage.exe`).
- App-defined Tauri commands are callable by any script in the webview (no ACL): validate every
  argument in Rust. Images over IPC go through `tray::decode_rgba` (size caps, no u32 overflow);
  `run_in_terminal` only runs its exact allow-list.
- No telemetry: the upstream Aptabase ping (reported to upstream's account) was removed in 0.7.0.
  Don't add analytics back.

## Verify before committing
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` · `bun run test` (src + plugins) · `cd src-tauri && cargo test --lib`.
- Vitest `testTimeout` is 20 s on purpose (cold transform of a file's first test is slow on
  Windows under load); don't lower it to "fix" speed — a timeout there is not a logic failure.

## Dependencies & releases
- `bunfig.toml` has `minimumReleaseAge` (7 days): don't force newer packages.
- Tauri JS packages and Rust crates must share **major.minor** (`@tauri-apps/api` ↔ `tauri`,
  `@tauri-apps/plugin-x` ↔ `tauri-plugin-x`); the Tauri CLI refuses to build otherwise. Adding a
  crate can silently bump `tauri` in Cargo.lock: check the lock diff (`tauri-plugin-single-instance`
  is pinned `=2.4.5` because 2.5 needs tauri 2.12).
- A second launch only shows the running app's panel (single-instance plugin), and the app exits at
  once in session 0 (an installer running as SYSTEM). Both make the MSI's `AUTOLAUNCHAPP=True`
  (Tauri's template starts the app after install) safe for winget: add
  `InstallerSwitches: Custom: AUTOLAUNCHAPP=True` to the winget installer manifest (from 0.7.1).
- Release: bump the version in `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
  (+ `Cargo.lock`), add a `## vX.Y.Z` section to `CHANGELOG.md` (required: it becomes the release
  body the in-app changelog shows), then push a `v*` tag → `publish.yml` (windows-latest) builds
  NSIS + MSI and signs updater artifacts with the `TAURI_SIGNING_*` repo secrets. The updater points
  at this fork's `latest.json`, never upstream's. `git fetch upstream` must not bring upstream's
  Swift `v0.7.x` tags (`remote.upstream.tagOpt --no-tags`).
- Workflow actions are pinned to full commit SHAs (version in a comment) and Bun to an exact
  version; bump them deliberately. The winget job needs a valid `WINGET_TOKEN` (classic PAT,
  `public_repo` + `workflow`): the branch it creates in the `PowerUserZ/winget-pkgs` fork carries
  upstream's `.github/workflows` changes, and without `workflow` GitHub refuses it
  ("does not have the correct permissions to execute `CreateRef`", 0.7.0). If it fails, submit
  with komac (see memory).
- The owner's hook blocks force pushes (and a few destructive git commands); plain pushes pass.
- `.claude/skills/tauri-*` are real copies (git symlinks don't work on Windows without
  Developer Mode); keep them in sync with `.agents/skills/` if you edit one.
