# OpenTokenUsage

Every AI coding limit, next to your clock. Made for **Windows 11** by [PowerUserZ](https://github.com/PowerUserZ). Website: [opentokenusage.app](https://opentokenusage.app)

OpenTokenUsage lives in the notification area and shows how much of your AI coding subscriptions you've used: session and weekly limits, credits, when they reset, and whether you're on pace. No digging through dashboards, no mental math.

## Download

**Install with [WinGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/) (recommended):**

```powershell
winget install PowerUserZ.OpenTokenUsage
```

Or [**download the latest release**](https://github.com/PowerUserZ/OpenTokenUsage/releases/latest) and run the installer.

The app checks for new releases in-app and updates itself.

## What It Does

- **One glance.** All your AI tools in one panel, opened from the tray or a global shortcut. Pin it above other windows, or have it open where you left it.
- **Next to the clock.** The tray shows the app icon, a percent, bars, or one number or logo ring per provider.
- **Taskbar strip (experimental).** Provider logos with session and weekly usage right in the taskbar, in your own fonts, colors and order.
- **Pace.** Every limit says whether you're ahead or behind, and when it runs out at this rate.
- **Notifications.** At the usage levels you pick, when you're on pace to run out before a reset, and when a limit resets, with a built-in sound or your own.
- **One-click fixes.** Errors come with the fix: run the login command in a terminal, or open the provider's API key page and Windows' Environment Variables.
- **Service status.** A badge on the card when the provider's status page reports an incident.
- **Windows 11 native.** Mica, your accent color, a pure black dark theme and a light one.
- **11 languages.** English, Deutsch, Español (España and Latinoamérica), Français, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Português (Brasil), Türkçe and 简体中文.
- **Plugin-based.** Each provider is a small plugin, so adding one is easy. New providers arrive with app updates.
- **[Local HTTP API](docs/local-http-api.md).** Other apps on your PC can read your usage from `127.0.0.1:6736` (loopback only).
- **[Proxy support](docs/proxy.md).** Route provider requests through a SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy.

## Make It Yours

Settings → **Tray icon** picks what sits next to the clock. Settings → **Taskbar strip** puts logos with session and weekly numbers into the taskbar: choose up to 6 providers and their order, the font and size, and a color scale that warms up as you use more.
